          When you do something noble and beautiful and nobody noticed, do not
          be sad. For the sun every morning is a beautiful spectacle and yet
          most of the audience still sleeps. Keep your face to the sunshine and
          you cannot see a shadow.

            Nature has two inter-related meanings in philosophy and natural
            philosophy. On the one hand, it means the set of all things which
            are natural, or subject to the normal working of the laws of nature.
            On the other hand, it means the essential properties and causes of
            individual things. How to understand the meaning and significance of
            nature has been a consistent theme of discussion within the history
            of Western Civilization, in the philosophical fields of metaphysics
            and epistemology, as well as in theology and science. The study of
            natural things and the regular laws which seem to govern them, as
            opposed to discussion about what it means to be natural, is the area
            of natural science.

            During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several
            centuries, nature became the passive reality, organized and moved by
            divine laws.[3][4] With the Industrial Revolution, nature
            increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from
            intentional intervention: it was hence considered as sacred by some
            traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum
            for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx). However, a
            vitalist vision of nature, closer to the pre-Socratic one, got
            reborn at the same time, especially after Charles Darwin

            Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to
            geology and wildlife. Nature can refer to the general realm of
            living beings, and in some cases to the processes associated with
            inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and
            change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the
            Earth. It is often taken to mean the "natural environment" or
            wilderness—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things
            that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or
            which persist despite human intervention.

            For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally
            are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example,
            "human nature" or "the whole of nature". This more traditional
            concept of natural things that can still be found today implies a
            distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the
            artificial being understood as that which has been brought into
            being by a human consciousness or a human mind. Depending on the
            particular context, the term "natural" might also be distinguished
            from the unnatural or the supernatural

            A flower, also known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive
            structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division
            Angiospermae). Flowers consist of a combination of vegetative organs
            sepals that enclose and protect the developing flower. These petals
            attract pollinators, and reproductive organs that produce
            gametophytes, which in flowering plants produce gametes. The male
            gametophytes, which produce sperm, are enclosed within pollen grains
            produced in the anthers. The female gametophytes are contained
            within the ovules produced in the ovary.
